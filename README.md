# Detect_Pneumonia_Xray

In this Github, you can find the work I did with two of my fellow comrades, Mohammed Nafeez Abubacker and Jella Carillo in the context of our  Master in Data Science & Business Analytics (from Essec Business School & CentraleSuplec in France).

For our Deep Learning Course, we chose to develop aglorithms to detect pneumonia on a set of about 5000 Chest X-ray images.

We used three "classic" Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) (AlexNet, ResNet18 and VGG16). We alos trained two custom CNN algorithms.

We got the best results with ResNet18  (accuracy of 83% and a recall -false negative rate- of 99%).

You can also find herewith our final report as well as the ppt presentation detailing our methodologies and results.

Good reading !
